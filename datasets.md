The collection follows the established categorization format from popular NSFW detection implementations, providing a comprehensive benchmark for content moderation systems. The dataset contains images organized into five distinct classes that represent different levels of appropriateness and content types commonly encountered in online platforms. The classification framework divides images into drawing, hentai, neutral, porn, and sexy categories, enabling models to distinguish between various types of potentially sensitive content with fine-grained precision.},
